# WF Rehosted Designer with Roslyn C# Expression Editor

The rehostable designer in Workflow Foundation is limited to only allow Visual Basic expressions. This project
is to show how it is possible to use Roslyn for C# expressions. Roslyn is used to parse the code into syntax 
trees that can be used to fill completion windows. The user interface is powered by AvalonEdit.
